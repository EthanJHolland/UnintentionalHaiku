# Unintentional Haiku

Find 5-7-5-syllable poems in your word documents and display them over images Ã  la Pinterest. Note that this is an oversimplified definition of [Haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) and these are not true Haiku.

Images from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/). Inspired by [Times Haiku](http://haiku.nytimes.com/) and [Accidental Haiku](https://twitter.com/accidental575). More examples from my file system can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/gp/160109085@N08/qx711z). You can find a work-in-progress version in [haiku-complaint](https://xkcd.com/554/) form in `haiku-in-haiku.py`.

Usage: `py haiku.py [root filepath]`

Example: `py haiku.py C:\`
